# COVID-19 Data Analysis

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis project! This repository contains Python Jupyter notebooks and scripts exploring COVID-19 data sourced from the Our World in Data (OWID) database.

> **Note:** This is a basic-level practice project created to test and enhance my data analysis and visualization skills using **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.
**More Advance part of this Project will be announced soon in the form of PowerBi Visuals**

## Overview

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data to uncover important trends and insights about the pandemic. Key questions addressed include:
- How has the pandemic evolved over time globally and by country?
- What are the patterns in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates?
- How do different regions compare in terms of pandemic impact and response?

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Using Python with **NumPy** and **Pandas** to preprocess and clean the OWID COVID-19 dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visual and statistical exploration of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination progress.
- **Data Visualization:** Clear and informative charts using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to highlight trends and comparisons.
- **Documented Jupyter Notebooks:** Step-by-step analyses with explanations and visualizations for reproducibility and easy understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-data-analysis.git
   cd covid19-data-analysis
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open and run the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to explore the COVID-19 data analysis.
